      Vikramaditya was a great king who ruled over a prosperous kingdom from his
      capital at Ujjain. He had immense love for learning as well as for
      adventure. He was brave, fearless, and with a strong will. Every day many
      visitors used to visit the king and gift him something. The King used to
      accept all the gifts with the same courtesy. Among such visitors was a
      mendicant who presented the king with fruit on every visit. King
      Vikramaditya used to hand over the fruit to the royal storekeeper. One day
      while handling the fruit, it broke and from the top came out a handy ball
      of a ruby. The King was surprised. He ordered to check all the fruits, and
      from all fruits came out a fine ruby. The King decided to meet the
      mendicant. However, the mendicant had set a condition that the King must
      meet him under a Banyan tree in the center of the cremation ground beyond
      the city, at night, on the 14th day of the dark half of the month. King
      met him as decided. The King asked the mendicant why he was doing this.
      The mendicant tells that there is a task that only a King like
      Vikramaditya can perform. King Vikramaditya had to visit the northernmost
      corner of this ground where he would find a very ancient tree. There would
      be a corpse hanging from one of its branches. He would have to fetch it
      for the mendicant, as the mendicant was seeking certain occult powers
      which he would get only if a king brought this particular corpse to him
      and if he would practice certain rites sitting on it. According to the
      legend the King Vikramaditya, in order to fulfill a vow, was required to
      remove a corpse of Betaal from a treetop and carry it on his shoulder to
      another place in silence. En route, the spirit of Betaal (in the corpse)
      used to narrate a story to the king and after completing the story Betaal
      would pose a query that if he (The king) knew the answer, was bound to
      respond lest he will break his head into thousand pieces. But if he does
      speak out, he would break the vow of silence and Betaal would fly back to
      the treetop, leaving the king inches short of his destination. The king
      would go after the vetala and start all over again. As the name 'Betaal
      Pachisi' suggests the Betaal told King 25 stories. ('Pachisi' (Hindi) is
      derived from the word 'Pachis' in Hindi which means twenty-five) .
      However, looking at the determination of the king Vikramaditya, Betaal
      finally disclosed the true motive of the mendicant. The mendicant's plan
      was to practice certain rites sitting on Betaal but he would kill the
      King, to get all the powers of world. This created suspicion in
      Vikramaditya's mind. However, he still went to the mendicant, but he was
      prepared for a surprise. Betaal proved to be right and the mendicant tried
      to kill Vikramaditya. However, Vikramaditya outwitted the mendicant and
      killed him.
