      Hearing King Vikram's reply, Betal tells him that he has taken a good
      decision. But as per my condition you were not supposed to speak and you
      spoke again. That's why I'm going. Betal again goes to its tree and hangs
      itself. Vikram He catches Betal again and takes him away and Betal again
      treats him like a prince. Listens to the story whose name was
      Jimutavahana. a wither in the prince's garden There was a plant, he feels
      sad after seeing that plant and wants to take care of it. He takes
      responsibility himself and takes care of that plant daily, the plant
      becomes green again. gets filled and after a long time that plant becomes
      a tree, that tree He becomes pleased with the prince's service and the
      tree that carries Jimutvahan says And says that I am Kalpavriksha and I am
      happy with your service. You will get what you asked for. The prince says
      that I am a prince, I don't know anything. Do not want. So the Kalpa tree
      tells him that if not for himself then for his family. When asked for it,
      Prince Jimutvahan says that we are the king and the king's family. They
      are his people. If you have to give, then give for the people so that
      their sorrows are not spared. Can get away. The Kalpa tree reveals a lot
      of wealth and tells the prince It is said that oh king, remove the
      sufferings of your people and says that the greatness of life It's not
      about being happy yourself, it's about removing the sorrow of others.
      Prince Jimutvahan distributes all that wealth among the people. So a woman
      doesn't want money from him She takes it and tells them that she does not
      want money, please protect our race. very will. So the prince asks her
      what happened that she is crying. So The woman tells them that they belong
      to a snake tribe that lives in the mountains. A huge bird comes there and
      carries away a man. As such This happens every day, one by one we will be
      eliminated, so I ask you for help. Have come to ask. The prince promises
      that he will go to the Malayalam Mountains tomorrow itself. And will
      protect them. Jimutavahana reaches the tribe of snake caste. snake The
      daughter of the king of the tribe welcomes the prince and invites him to
      rest. When she asks for it, the prince tells her that he will not rest now
      if When he rested, another Jain would leave. The prince moves forward and
      The person who becomes food for the giant bird meets Shankchur's mother
      and tells her He says that he will take his son's place and he will
      sacrifice his life. Shankchur's mother She goes to him and tells him that
      today her life has been saved because The prince has promised to sacrifice
      his life. Shankchud instead of his life Won't let anyone else take it.
      Even if a huge bird comes, Shankchud Jimutvahan He says that you cannot
      sacrifice your life in my place. Jimutvahan says that I am a Kshatriya and
      my duty is to protect you. Argument between the two. It gets spilled.
      Seeing this the huge bird asks Jimutavahana about him. Why has he come
      here? Jimutvahana asks the bird to protect him. He has come here to
      protect his people and he will kill them too. Will give. The huge bird
      becomes happy after listening to the prince and tells him that How will
      they get food? Prince Jimutvahana tells them that from today onwards they
      will Will arrange food. Hearing this the bird leaves from there. Now from
      Betal Vikram He asks, now tell me who is brave between Shankchud and
      Jimutvahan? Shankchud is brave because Prince Jimutavahana took his place.
      Even after that he came there and stopped the one who sacrificed his life.
      gives. Arrangement of food for that huge bird Jimutavahana with the help
      of Kalpa tree. gets it done
